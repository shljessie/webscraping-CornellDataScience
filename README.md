# webscraping-CornellDataScience


### What is Webscraping?
Web crawling is the process of systematically browsing the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing.
Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It might require some crawling to access information hidden behind links on a page.
Web scraping a web page involves downloading the page (which a browser does when you view it) and then extracting the content from it
