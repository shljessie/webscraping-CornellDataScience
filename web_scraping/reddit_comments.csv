It's all about whether you believe bodily continuity is an important facet of identity. Locke says the thing that makes you you is solely the fact that you have a continuous stream of memories that connect current you to past you. Obviously this brings into play the pretty interesting extreme case to consider of having something like a brain transplant into another body, or dying and moving on to some sort of afterlife. Are you really still you in either of these cases? There's lots of great reading to be done on the subject to help you decide!  Edit: this comment ended up being submitted like four times so I deleted three of them. Never deleted a comment before so I'm not sure exactly what will happen but I thought it was worth a mention"

283476,https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5gn8ru/guardians_of_the_front_page/,79,DucksOnduckOnDucks,"Great question! Locke's argument here is that while you're sleeping you actually don't exist at all. Obviously what this means is a little confusing, someone can clearly observe you sleeping and even film you sleeping and show you afterwards to prove that you ""existed"" while sleeping. But the concept of what it means for you to exist is a little more complicated than that. Certainly you wouldn't argue that you exist when you're dead because your corpse hasn't completely rotted away. So are you really yourself in a state of non-consciousness like sleeping? It's a difficult idea to wrestle with.  As far as being a new you when you wake up, the memory theory idea of the self says when you wake up as long as you remember being you before you fell asleep you're still the same you, you just weren't you while you were asleep.  If this is something you find interesting I'd recommend reading chapter XXVII of Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding titled: Of Identity and Diversity. Locke's English is a little hard to follow and it's kind of dense but pretty interesting. Memory Theory in some form or another is a really widely accepted identity theory among philosophers but some really great philosophers have other ideas as well. If you're interested in something a little different you could check out David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature this is a big book and there's a specific chapter I think towards the end that is relevant to identity theory where he essentially argues there is no concrete ""self."" It's worth checking out but I can't recall exactly which chapter it is."

He launched a drone program which has killed hundreds and hundreds of innocent people, often based on flimsy meta data!  Started under Bush, continued by Obama, and even further continued under the Trump administration.   He created new powers that allow authorities to detain Americans without trial.  This one is a half truth. He did create new powers. Beyond that though, the powers largely existed already, again under the patriot act passed by the Bush administration. Which is the next thing that he says:  He not only continued with the Patriot Act, he expanded it!  But he acts like it's a new fact. Again, Trump is showing no signs of acting differently in this regard. Instead he's expanding DHS's ability to harass citizens further.   He created new powers that allow authorities to detain Americans without trial.  Repeating himself. One thing I will say about this repetition however is that electing Hilary clinton wouldn't have changed any of this. So props to the Republican party for at least trying something different this time around, even if it is pretty clear that it still isn't changing.   He didn't accomplish any of his promises regarding the middle eastern conflicts, or shutting down extra-judicial prisons or treatment of prisoners - including torture.  Tacitly false. It wasn't a great choice, but he did cause a large scale down of both conflicts from when he took office.   He made it impossible to sue Monsanto  That was the legislative branch, not Obama.   He provided weapons to drug cartels in south America.  Definitely the worst thing Obama did during his tenure. I won't try to defend this one. It was bad.  He supported a tax funded bailout for the very same financial institutions that were responsible for it in the first place.  Nope, once again memories are short. He bailed out the Auto makers, but they weren't responsible for the financial crisis. TARP, which is what this guy was referencing was passed under Bush.

230829,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5bx4bx/thanks_obama/,467,Jgusdaddy,"Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America’s long-term fiscal problems. Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs. Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide “living wills” to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers’ money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies. Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country. Last troops left on December 18, 2011. Began Drawdown of War in Afghanistan: From a peak of 101,000 troops in June 2011, U.S. forces are now down to 91,000, with 23,000 slated to leave by the end of summer 2012. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, the combat mission there will be over by next year. Eliminated Osama bin laden: In 2011, ordered special forces raid of secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which the terrorist leader was killed and a trove of al-Qaeda documents was discovered. Turned Around U.S. Auto Industry: In 2009, injected $62 billion in federal money (on top of $13.4 billion in loans from the Bush administration) into ailing GM and Chrysler in return for equity stakes and agreements for massive restructuring. Since bottoming out in 2009, the auto industry has added more than 100,000 jobs. In 2011, the Big Three automakers all gained market share for the first time in two decades. The government expects to lose $16 billion of its investment, less if the price of the GM stock it still owns increases. Recapitalized Banks: In the midst of financial crisis, approved controversial Treasury Department plan to lure private capital into the country’s largest banks via “stress tests” of their balance sheets and a public-private fund to buy their “toxic” assets. Got banks back on their feet at essentially zero cost to the government. Repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Ended 1990s-era restriction and formalized new policy allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military for the first time. Toppled Moammar Gaddafi: In March 2011, joined a coalition of European and Arab governments in military action, including air power and naval blockade, against Gaddafi regime to defend Libyan civilians and support rebel troops. Gaddafi’s forty-two-year rule ended when the dictator was overthrown and killed by rebels on October 20, 2011. No American lives were lost. Told Mubarak to Go: On February 1, 2011, publicly called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to accept reform or step down, thus weakening the dictator’s position and putting America on the right side of the Arab Spring. Mubarak ended thirty-year rule when overthrown on February 11. Reversed Bush Torture Policies: Two days after taking office, nullified Bush-era rulings that had allowed detainees in U.S. custody to undergo certain “enhanced” interrogation techniques considered inhumane under the Geneva Conventions. Also released the secret Bush legal rulings supporting the use of these techniques. Improved America’s Image Abroad: With new policies, diplomacy, and rhetoric, reversed a sharp decline in world opinion toward the U.S. (and the corresponding loss of “soft power”) during the Bush years. From 2008 to 2011, favorable opinion toward the United States rose in ten of fifteen countries surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, with an average increase of 26 percent. Kicked Banks Out of Federal Student Loan Program, Expanded Pell Grant Spending: As part of the 2010 health care reform bill, signed measure ending the wasteful decades-old practice of subsidizing banks to provide college loans. Starting July 2010 all students began getting their federal student loans directly from the federal government. Treasury will save $67 billion over ten years, $36 billion of which will go to expanding Pell Grants to lower-income students. Created Race to the Top: With funds from stimulus, started $4.35 billion program of competitive grants to encourage and reward states for education reform. Boosted Fuel Efficiency Standards: Released new fuel efficiency standards in 2011 that will nearly double the fuel economy for cars and trucks by 2025. Coordinated International Response to Financial Crisis: To keep world economy out of recession in 2009 and 2010, helped secure from G-20 nations more than $500 billion for the IMF to provide lines of credit and other support to emerging market countries, which kept them liquid and avoided crises with their currencies. Passed Mini Stimuli: To help families hurt by the recession and spur the economy as stimulus spending declined, signed series of measures (July 22, 2010; December 17, 2010; December 23, 2011) to extend unemployment insurance and cut payroll taxes. Began Asia “Pivot”: In 2011, reoriented American military and diplomatic priorities and focus from the Middle East and Europe to the Asian-Pacific region. Executed multipronged strategy of positively engaging China while reasserting U.S. leadership in the region by increasing American military presence and crafting new commercial, diplomatic, and military alliances with neighboring countries made uncomfortable by recent Chinese behavior. Increased Support for Veterans: With so many soldiers coming home from Iraq and Iran with serious physical and mental health problems, yet facing long waits for services, increased 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs budget by 16 percent and 2011 budget by 10 percent. Also signed new GI bill offering $78 billion in tuition assistance over a decade, and provided multiple tax credits to encourage businesses to hire veterans. Tightened Sanctions on Iran: In effort to deter Iran’s nuclear program, signed Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (2010) to punish firms and individuals who aid Iran’s petroleum sector. In late 2011 and early 2012, coordinated with other major Western powers to impose sanctions aimed at Iran’s banks and with Japan, South Korea, and China to shift their oil purchases away from Iran. Created Conditions to Begin Closing Dirtiest Power Plants: New EPA restrictions on mercury and toxic pollution, issued in December 2011, likely to lead to the closing of between sixty-eight and 231 of the nation’s oldest and dirtiest coal-fired power plants. Estimated cost to utilities: at least $11 billion by 2016. Estimated health benefits: $59 billion to $140 billion. Will also significantly reduce carbon emissions and, with other regulations, comprises what’s been called Obama’s “stealth climate policy.” Passed Credit Card Reforms: Signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (2009), which prohibits credit card companies from raising rates without advance notification, mandates a grace period on interest rate increases, and strictly limits overdraft and other fees."

Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.

Like a month or two of suspension and a warning that if he does it again they'll throw the book at him. And this would not have been a story, at all. It probably would not have even registered in other ActiBlizz communities, let alone been a thing to people completely outside of gaming. Yet - thanks to their intense, burning desire to suck up to the CCP now EVERYONE knows about it. Even more people are now aware of all the vile shit China does, thanks to people linking stories about China's human right abuses under every Blizzard/China post on all the social media. And it's now very obvious that Blizzard is full of shit when they claim to support human rights (as they did with LGBT stuff). They don't. They like to say they do when it costs them nothing, but they don't. Well done, Blizzard. You failed to protect your chinese overlords and you failed to protect your image.

Now I cannot ignore this because the company that provides my entertainment and I pay money to chose to side with a bully who's wants are inconsistent with truthful, decent and humanitarian - for which I cannot ignore.

Instead they have created a situation where giving them money is giving support to Chinese oppression of Hong Kong and their human rights issues overall. They have made buying their products into an ethically problematic decision.

223265,https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/,7109,TheBirminghamBear,"Under new EU laws you can also demand they send you the data they have on you, and if they fail to respond in (i believe 30?) days, they're subject to massive fines.  This is a much better strategy than people in the EU deleting their accounts.  If even a fraction of people do so, it may very well overwhelm their ability to respond to requests, which would subject them to extraordinarily huge fines.  And you'll get your data, which is great, because if they're owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they've accumulated on you. This article has some info about the regulation.  EDIT: A commenter below has provided an excellent form letter people can send to Blizzard requesting specific types of personal data.  This is really great.  I know Blizzard has disabled their automated system, so it would be worth it to print this out and snail mail a copy to Blizzard HQ.   EDIT:  Another commenter details the inanity of complaints that people utilizing this law will somehow ""get it taken away A lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though. EDIT:  People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests.  I've heard 2 months of extra time.  I would say that's fine.  They can't just not fulfill the request.   Keep in mind the GDPR are new laws.  The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China. EDIT:  Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized.  I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this.  For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately ""malicious"".  For two, laws aren't usually chucked out the window because it's ""hard"" for companies to comply. EDIT:  Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is ""abusing"" it.  I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime.  That's why the law exists in the first place.  Insinuating they will ""take it away"" if you use it is absurd.   And if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data.  That's a good thing.  Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online.  It's your data, not their property.   We do not live in fear of corporations.  We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier.  If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are ""hard"", then we know the laws need to be strengthened. EDIT:  A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected.  It's really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users.  They're very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data.  There is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: stop compiling and reselling user data.  Blizzard doesn't have to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn't need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder. They could just, I dunno, make good games?"

Whatever the case may be in Philadelphia (do your own research and decide), it does not change the fact that China’s influences are here.

They established their first overseas military base in Africa recently. They are playing a generational game. One where China slowly absorbs the world, either by might or dollar. That is their plan anyway. Forcing the world to comply with their political beliefs in our media is a step - watch South Park (the latest season in a couple of episodes) - they lay it out.

I used to be a teacher and we knew if the parent came in smelling like alcohol at 3 in the afternoon (really ever but this is a common pick up time) we were not to release the child to them.  In a situation like this, where the girl isn't physically making any show of suffering or struggle, how do you know if it's that kind of situation? How do you know that they didn't just have a fight? Or the guy is a jerk, which is bad but not as bad as a kidnapper rapist And she was young - young kids wear weird shit. I used to go to school in pajama pants (I didn't actually sleep in pajama pants). Idk I thought it was cool but my teachers had to think something weird was going on at home right? Or did they just know I was a weird kid? There are so many factors at play. And just think, if this had gone the other way with a flight attendant making an accusation that turned out to have no weight behind it. She'd lose her job for harassing the guests!"

She managed to convince the girl to go to the bathroom where the flight attendant had left her a note stuck to the mirror.  You'd think that would be a red flag to the kidnapper that would raise suspicion.
222807,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5sfexx/this_is_shelia_fredrick_a_flight_attendant_she/,1265,budhs,"good question, but maybe she just said something like ""the seatbelt light is going on soon, if you need to use the bathroom you should do it now"" and the girl was stuck next to her trafficker who would usually probably not let her go to the bathroom or if she had to he would follow her, so she was probably desperate to get away from him for at least the shortest amount of time, either just so she could be alone or in the hopes that she could notify someone of her situation. With the flight attended standing there it wouldve looked suspicious for the trafficker to in any way try and stop her or remind her of threats or something or to follow her, so i think it's possible it may have raised some red flags with the kidnapper but there really isn't much he could do that wouldn't raise even bigger red flags with the airline company. God it's so horrible this kind of shit goes on... I've been taken against my will before and there really is no way to describe quite how desperate and helpless you feel when you're young. I was so desperate i tried to make things move with my mind. Ed. ITT: people who critising a human trafficking victim for not escaping sooner!

But Vietnam flashback there was this one time in 5th grade, on the day of our D.A.R.E. graduation, with a whole ceremony and a class picture, where I knew I was going to be upfront and center. I had sucked up to the police officer/instructor all fall/winter, because if you were super good at answering questions and volunteering, you got to hold Darren the DARE lion for the rest of class. I had not anticipated, that due to my outstanding DARE enthusiasm, I'd be placed in front holding said plush mascot. And my mom insisted I wear this Christmas vest to school. It had knitted candy canes dangling all over. Peppermint shaped buttons. It was awful. And also made for a 7 year old. Which was how old I was when I didn't care what bedazzled outerwear was thrust upon me. But at age 10 it was an elf sized Christmas monstrosity that cut off circulation to my arms and could barely be considered a mid drift.

222807,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5sfexx/this_is_shelia_fredrick_a_flight_attendant_she/,440,fzyflwrchld,"This happened to me to. My mom made me see my dad so I would believe her that he was kind of a dead beat. I was probably 8 or 9. I went to the mall with him. To me he was practically a stranger since my mom and I moved away from him when I was 2 so I had no memories of him. He'd been staying with us for a couple of days. I forget what exactly happened but he got really mad at me while we were at the mall and grabbed my arm really hard and dragged me away to go home. I didn't like the pain nor the being forced to go somewhere with this practical stranger whom I didn't see as having authority over me so I started crying and struggling and pulling away and yelling ""no! Let go!"" But it wasn't lost on me either that while i did know the man dragging me away, that if I was being kidnapped instead, it wouldn't make a difference, no one stopped to help or ask what was happening. I do remember a adult man looking at me sadly like he felt bad for me. And that's when I learned you can't depend on the kindness of strangers to help you. I'm biracial too and look nothing like my dad, it should've looked suspicious as hell but nobody cared.  Edit: I understand it's difficult to tell when a child is in actual distress. I'm just saying how it came off to a child that adults seem not to care if an adult you barely know is hurting you and forcing you to go somewhere with them. Imagine how much more distressing it is to a child who's actually in danger. What if I was being kidnapped and nobody did anything, afterwards (especially if I was subdued/abused/threatened in the meantime) the next time I'm in public with my captor I'd probably be less likely to say anything because I wouldn't think anyone would help me anyway and I'd just get in trouble with my captor. I just wanted to give perspective. Also why the saying is ""if you see something, say something""...doesn't mean you have to ""say something"" to the person you think is a bad guy, it really means say something to the authorities so they can follow up on it. Better safe than sorry. I also understand kids cry all the time, kind of like car alarms, if you hear a car alarm going off you never actually think a car is being stolen, but might help to look out the window just in case.      Edit 2: I'm not saying that me not looking like my dad is enough to warrant concern...I'm just saying it's a contributing factor to pause and question what's happening. And there's apparently a lot of people here that over estimate the ability of a distraught child to be thoughtful and rational... like knowing the right words to yell to get help...or, for example, me assuming that the strangers would know that I barely knew the man dragging me away. I'm saying that AS A CHILD I didn't understand why nobody wanted to help me or was concerned at all for my safety. I'm an adult now, thank you...and so are you and might take it for granted how a child perceives these things. There's a few adults here that like to assume children are logical creatures when in distress, hard to manipulate, and are generally just misbehaving assholes whenever they show signs of distress (validating the comment I was originally replying to)."

He was well-dressed. That’s what got me because I thought why is he well-dressed and she is looking all dishevelled and out of sorts?” Ms Frederick told the programme. When she tried to speak with the two passengers, the man reportedly became defensive and the girl wouldn't engage in conversation. Ms Frederick said she subsequently left a note for the teenager in the plane's toilet, which she later responded to with the message: “I need help.” The flight attendant informed pilots who were then able to communicate the message to police in San Francisco, and the man was arrested when the flight landed. Ms Frederick added: “I've been a flight attendant for 10 years and it's like I am going all the way back to when I was in training and I was like, I could have seen these young girls and young boys and didn't even know.”"

A teen can get manipulated or forced into prostitution and once they start a cycle of being in the system and getting a record it's hard to get out. Their pimp (sometimes boyfriend or older male friend, they aren't all kidnap victims) gets them strung out on drugs and makes them sell themselves to keep income coming in and they use the drug as leverage. If she gets attested the police don't have the resources or the culture to help the girl who can't help herself. It's all jail and court fines. So of course she feels trapped. Society already sees her as scum because of being a prostitute. It takes a very dedicated social worker to help turn around that negative thinking and get her out of there.  There was an interview from NPR, I want to say it was on Fresh Air where a girl like this describes how she was forced into prostitution when she was 13 by her 18 year old boyfriend, and how being treated like a worthless criminal kept her going back to him because she felt like she had no choice. I can't find the interview, I'm on mobile and it was a few years ago. That program left an impression though"

Westerners here laugh at it because they want to keep fucking young girls and boys. Locals deny it because of pride and the ability to make easy money. You quickly become a pariah by observing the fucking obvious. It's enough to make a person go mad. The saddest thing is most human trafficking victims go unnoticed because they don't work in the sex industry or anything closely related to sex. If you've eaten shrimp in the last month there's a good chance you've been complicit in the modern slavery of children. And there's precious little any of us can do about any of it.

There are so many of these victims of child labor, slavery, and human trafficking everywhere. There is child labor in so many small business (chai shops and stuff) because poor families have way more than 2 or 3 kids so they can be fed.    They get easy money, get easy way to fill their stomachs because if they don't, they will die. The movie Lion does a very good job showing this, because millions of poor teens have to find work instead of staying in school because they need the money now. So many foreigners don't see it prevalently, and so many locals keep mum about it because it keeps things low.  And with slavery. There are so many families who have been abused by the owners of large estates and rich men because they don't do their job rights. Usually they clean homes and do odd jobs. There are also millions of families who have enslaved in brick kilns across the country for not paying microloans to the Don because the banks won't give them money. And these people give money to politicians who exploit the cate system for their own gain. It's disgusting and has left thousands without a decent family for ages.  And then there is the human trafficking, which is another outlet of the slavery. Often times, women in the slums have to sell their bodies to make some decent cash for their kids. Many are forced into the trade. Especially with Muslims, people from other countries pay goons to kidnap young girls, even college age ones and traffic them to the Arab world as dancers. Young women get married to pimps to ensure they get more. They also traffic men as workers to build the magnificent buildings you see. And the ones who come legally, they get their passports locked away and could face harsh things if they don't comply.  This is a reality so many Indians see and deal with. So, I can relate to someone from thailand. It's sad that so many people profit from the vulnerabilities of the poor and don't care about other men."

But I can't help thinking sometimes – and I might as well say it – you, the Chinese, you are not worth my struggle! You are not worth my sacrifice! What we actually are hoping for is bloodshed, the moment when the government is ready to brazenly butcher the people. Only when the Square is awash with blood will the people of China open their eyes. Only then will they really be united. But how can I explain any of this to my fellow students? ""And what is truly sad is that some students, and famous well-connected people, are working hard to help the government, to prevent it from taking such measures. For the sake of their selfish interests and their private dealings they are trying to cause our movement to disintegrate and get us out of the Square before the government becomes so desperate that it takes action.... Interviewer: ""Are you going to stay in the Square yourself? Chai Ling: ""No."" Interviewer: ""Why?"" Chai Ling: ""Because my situation is different. My name is on the government's blacklist. I'm not going to be destroyed by this government. I want to live. Anyway, that's how I feel about it. I don't know if people will say I'm selfish. I believe that people have to continue the work I have started. A democracy movement can't succeed with only one person. I hope you don't report what I've just said for the time being, okay?"""

223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,7140,doublewhiskeysoda,"Sure. Here goes:  A long time ago, Hong Kong was a British-held territory. In the late 90s, the Brits decided to leave Hong Kong and allow China to manage the city. Because of the political/philosophical differences in the ways the Brits and Chinese run their societies, when the handover occurred, the Chinese agreed to allow Hong Kong citizens more freedoms than they allow Chinese citizens in other parts of their country. They called this agreement a “one country, two systems” plan.  Since the handover, however, China has steadily been reducing the freedoms promised to the people of Hong Kong. In 2014, for example, there were huge protests in Hong Kong because of a plan to allow Hong Kong citizens to vote for their leaders - but only from a list of Beijing-approved candidates. This event was called “the Umbrella Revolution.” The Hong Kong citizens lost that fight.  This current round of protests began because of another legal issue - extradition. The (relative) freedom of speech is one of the human rights that Hong Kong has been allowed by the Chinese government that isn’t generally allowed to other Chinese citizens. Now, China wants to enact a law that will allow Hong Kong citizens who publish or produce defamatory texts critical of the Chinese government to be extradited to mainland China to face trial in those courts, under the standard Chinese law. Basically, China is slowly trying to get rid of the “two systems” part of their Hong Kong handover agreement.  Imagine that the US had laws that made it criminal to openly criticize Donald Trump - but for some reason people in Miami had more legal freedom to do so. Then imagine that the US government decides it wants to prosecute people in Miami for exercising that right. It can’t prosecute them in Miami because criticizing Trump is legal there, so maybe they’ll bring them out of Miami up to Atlanta and try them there. People in Miami would be pissed.  To get a sense of the scope of the thing, consider this - there are 7 million Hong Kong citizens. More than a million of them showed up to protest the extradition law a couple of months ago. More than one out of every seven Hong Kong citizens was standing in a street publicly protesting. It would be roughly equivalent to 50 million Americans protesting at once.  Anyway, that’s how the current round of protests started. Of course, many protestors are no longer limiting themselves to a simple extradition law. They’re gunning for full control. Good on ‘em. I hope they can pull it off."

223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,1233,thedennisinator,"This is something you should really google yourself for a thorough explanation, but I'll try my best. BTW, this is as condensed as any explanation of a complex topic can be, so don't expect a TL;DR:  China used to be the biggest dick in all of Asia, and it had a very ethnocentric society and mindset. The Chinese word for China is literally ""Middle Kingdom,"" as they saw themselves as the center of the world, which for all of their intents and purposes was Asia and some of the Middle East. China traded with the West, but the trade was imbalanced. Chinese didn't buy many Western goods but Western countries were obsessed with silk, porcelein etc. Countries like Britain were losing silver because all of it was going to China and not coming back. England's solution was to start a state sanctioned opium trade in China so Chinese would buy something from the West. China's government didn't like that it's citizens were getting addicted to opium, so it banned the trade. Britain's solution was to invade China and force the trade open. China had failed to develop its military since it hadn't needed to until then, and was conpletely defeated. Thus, Britain forced the opium trade back open and also took Hong Kong as a colony. Additionally, it took control of 5 of China's biggest ports.  Over the next 100 years, China was invaded again by Britain, as well as France, Russia, Portugal, and Germany. Each nation took large chunks of land and made their citizens immune to any Chinese laws. This broke down Chinese society and economy, leading to civil wars that killed 60-70 million Chinese. China's economy went from the world's largest to being almost insignificant. Additionally, nearby Japan saw that China was now weak and invaded China twice, killing over 30 million more Chinese citizens in a particularly brutal fashion (rape and pillaging by soldiers, live human medical experimentation etc.) This affects relations between the countries to this day. The only government that succeeded in uniting China and freeing it from colonialism was the Communist Party. Unfortunately, they were rather incompetent and ended up starving an additional 30 million Chinese before they got their act together. After embracing state-run capitalism, China once again entered the world stage as a militarily significant power. Here's the kicker: Hong Kong was still under British control and literally symbolized China's past 100 years of suffering and over 100 million Chinese deaths. This gave it incredible importance in the Chinese psyche and immense symbolic value to the CCP. Britain had actually leased some territory north of HK, and when the lease expired, China asked for HK itself back and implied there would be war otherwise. Britain had no stomach for a war over HK and handed it back under the stipulation that democracy and basic civil rights be preserved for 50 more years.  In summary, HK represents the beginning of 100 years of pure chaos, suffering, and humiliation in China that most people in the West have no idea about. China went from thinking it was the center of the world to being a colony in 50 years. Reclaiming HK symbolized China's emergence from this period as a world power, and China will hold onto it at any cost, both as a important mechanism of legitimacy for the CCP and a symbol of redemption to the Chinese people."

In 1997 when the handover occurred, the Cold War was over, free trade agreements were all the rage, global popular anger was generally focused on the capitalist method of globalization, there was no war on terror. It was a different place politically speaking.  If the Brits had wanted to keep Hong Kong, they would’ve figured out some way to make that happen. Because of the political environment of the time, the Brits determined that it wasn’t in their best interests to keep Hong Kong. I don’t know why - maybe because having traditional colonies is considered bad form among “developed” nations, maybe because they wanted to have a closer relationship with China, maybe because relinquishing control would have had knock-on effects with other governments that they considered advantageous to them in some other way.  Regardless of how HK came into England’s area of influence, when they backed out in 1997 it was because they felt it was the best course of action."

223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,213,DarknessRain,"HK used to be a British colony rented from the Chinese govt. The rental lease ended so it returned to Chinese control from Britain. HK people got used to Western liberalism and don't want to be the same as the rest of China. China let them have their own system of separate laws for 50 years.  ​ The 50 years has not ended yet but there was a law introduced allowing China to prosecute people in HK for breaking China laws (essentially ending the separate law systems). HK people are pissed about this law and protested to end it. It got temporarily scrapped but it's not enough, they want the top policymaker out for being a Chinese puppet and introducing the extradition law in the first place."
223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,124,defenestrate_urself,Lol. I wouldn't call it 'rented' that would imply China received something of value in exchange. It's a bit like saying Germany just wanted to visit it's neighbors during WW2 The law in question wasn't a prosecution law. It was an extradition law proposed by HK govt with Taiwan and China due to a murder of a HK girl by her HK bf whilst the couple were in Taiwan. He managed to escape back to HK and could not be extradited back to TW. A lot of HK people were against an extradition agreement with China as they don't trust the rule of law there and there were mass peaceful protests to repeal it. In practical terms they were successful but now it's descended into riots with protestors vs the govt/police
223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,55,VisonKai,"Just so its clear, because Im not sure its obvious from your comment, the Taiwanese government is opposed to the extradition law and most observers believe the Taiwanese story is pretextual justification to pass a law enabling extradition of mainland criminals in HK to the mainland."

223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,70,thedennisinator,"Your use of the word ""rented"" without further explanation is simplistic in the extreme and is actually not true (HK was ceded in perpetuity and only the New Territories were rented). It shows a lack of understanding of probably the most defining moments of modern China, the Opium Wars, and fails to illustrate why China cares so much about Hong Kong in the first place. I strongly suggest you watch this video for more context on the situation."
223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,55,OnlyJustOnce,I also wouldn’t say hk got used to western liberalism. HK was very much a colony. They only got the right to vote and semi-autonomy when the Joint Sino-British Declaration was signed. The current generation of protesters don’t remember or haven’t even lived under British rule. They are just angry at the lack of promised freedom.
223579,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/,89,thedennisinator,"In the late 1800's, Britain started importing opium to China to address a trade imbalance. China banned opium, so Britain invaded China in the Opium Wars, which kicked off around 100 years of suffering, strife, and European colonialism in China and also got the Brits Hong Kong. Britain later rented more territory from China, called the New Territories.  After China emerged from the period of strife (google Century of Humiliation), China wanted HK and the New Territories back and Britain allowed it on the condition that democracy be allowed in Hong Kong for 50 years after the handover. China initially permitted this, as HK was a disproportionately huge part of its economy, but HK is no longer as important economically. The economic tradeoff for more control is now worth it to the Chinese government, which is why they have recently been eroding the freedoms HK citizens used to enioy.  More recently, China has tried to pass a law that would basically let them take people from Hong Kong and try them in mainland courts. This is important because people that did things that are legal in HK but not in the mainland could be arrested and sent to China, where they would likely be imprisoned, tortured, etc. The law basically will end free speech and democracy in HK before the 50 year period has passed. The reason China cares about a small southern island is twofold:  First, the cession of HK marks the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, which is the ABSOLUTE MOST IMPORTANT period in modern Chinese history. The only reason the Chinese Communist Party is tolerated is because they were the only ones that were able to drag China out of that mess. Retaking HK is extremely important symbolically to the Chinese government and national psyche. Second, China has other seperatist movements going on in Xinjiang and Tibet. If China let HK go free, the other regions would likely be encouraged to push for independence. China's absolute biggest priority is to maintain unity, as they saw disunity as one of the primary reasons for the Century of Humiliation. Thus, the Chinese government is heavily invested in maintaining control at any cost.  I know you asked for a simple explanation, but anything else but this wall of text would not provide the sufficient historical context. TL;DR: China got fucked by Britain and Britain got HK. HK had freedom very briefly before the handover(they were colonial subjects for much longer) but now they belong to China and are having their rights taken away. China cares about HK because it symbolizes why they got fucked for 100 years. Edited for some errors"

Call, email, or tweet your elected officials and urge them to support the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong. This tool lets you look up your representatives in the house and senate and provides phone numbers, email addresses, and facebook and twitter links. They actually recommend social media.

I  discussed the broadband package that will best suit and told him I've found a cheap TV phone and broadband bundle that is actually cheaper than what hes paying.

I'm going to consider moving my mobile services over to this company"". I was rewarded with an extra break and told to keep it up...

218176,https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/d2bwot/printers/,142,626Aussie,"Instead of automatically paying everyone for 40-hours every week, my center switched over to having us clock in & out on a computer. One computer, so only one person could clock in & out at a time, but they gave us 5 minutes leeway. If you tried to clock in or out more than 5 minutes early or 5-minutes late you had to get a manager to enter their code to approve your time, but up to 5-minutes either side of your scheduled time was a-okay. What was funny (to me) was that while everyone else was trying to clock in & out right on time, I was clocking in 5 minutes early every day. At lunch time I'd clock out 5 minutes late, take a 50 minute lunch, and clock back in 5 minutes early. And at the end of the day I'd let others clock out first before I'd clock out. And I'd clock out 5 minutes late, of course. That 20-minutes a day added up to 1h40m for week, so every week I was getting 1h40m of OT. Paid OT. It was a nice little bonus for a call center desk jockey. After a month or so one of the bean counters or someone in accounting finally realized one of the peons was getting OT. They didn't talk to me about it though, probably because I wasn't actually doing anything wrong.  It's not like I was clocking in late or clocking out early, the very opposite in fact. I was a model employee. Perhaps a little too model ;) Instead of talking to me personally, a Memo went out, reminding everyone to clock in & out on time. Not early or late, on time. They also reduced the clock in & out leeway to 2-minutes, which cut my OT ""bonus"" in half, but also pissed off a lot of people who had gotten a little too used to being able to clock in up to 5 minutes late. I was already interviewing for a new job by then, so I wasn't upset at losing half my OT bonus ;)"

If you hit the headset button on the physical phone it would log you out of the soft phone too (also hang up on the customer but it would appear as a dropped call not as agent hung up). The moment you accidently hit the headset button on your physical phone a manager would be running over to you screaming at you to log back in.  My managers got a lot of exercise (more so the fat ones) when I was on shift. If I needed a managers attention, or if I was bored I would  ""accidentally"" press the headset button and watch the fat drones storm over to me before I log back in."

The ridiculous thing is they actually used this to write up their best salesperson. She was clocking in on time, but sometimes not logging in on her soft phone until almost 10 minutes later. What was she doing, the bean counters wanted to know. Using the restroom, then getting coffee/water, etc. They wanted her to use the restroom and get coffee/water (etc.) before clocking in. She was their top seller, by a mile. They eventually scrapped the top seller bonus because for months it was going to her, nobody else but her, and nobody could even come close to her numbers, so she was never in any danger of never getting the top seller bonus. She was not happy when they scrapped it, and even less happy when they started in on her about using the restroom on company time. The stupid thing is they used to do business with a lot of very large companies, she had a very good reputation with many of those companies (hence her being their top seller), and so it did not take her very long to land a new job with the hours she wanted. It's funny how bean counters would look at the bottom line without ever considering how employee morale impacted the bottom line."

No biggie, this is obviously because of the call routing issue and this weeks metrics will probably omit the call transfer rate. Nope I was disciplined because of a high transfer rate. I argued that its high because of that one day of call route issues. They said that its an average over my working week so I should have made less transfers to compensate for the influx due to the problems we had. The problem happened on a thursday. I had my meeting on the Friday. I had less that one shift to ""compensate for the influx of transferes"".

A young man considering a vocation with the Franciscans was invited to dinner at the local friary one evening.  As dinner went on, from time-to-time, one of the friars would stand up and say a number and the other friars would laugh hysterically.  One stood up and said, “72,” and everyone laughed. Another said, “149,” and again everyone laughed. “14,” someone shouted and, again, everyone laughed.  Confused, the young man asked what was going on.  “Well, you see, we’ve all lived together for a long time,” the friar next to him told him. “By now, we know all the jokes by heart, and we numbered them all to save time. Someone says a number, we remember the joke, and laugh. Why don’t you give it a try? We have 300 jokes. Just stand and say any number you like.” The young man stood tentatively and said, “107,” and there was nothing but silence. The man sat down and asked what went wrong.  The friar shook his head and said, “What can I tell you? Some people just can’t tell a joke.”"

Most IT departments have a ""going green"" initiative, but that's really not stopped anyone from printing stuff they don't need to print esp in color.   For home office users like myself, I use a monochrome HP LJ P1102W laser.  I bought a Brother all in one Printer/Scanner with ADF.  It no longer has ink, I just use it for scanning, works great especially on 25 page documents.

I can't even describe what happened next. As I saw the car make impact, my entire mind went completely blank except for my daughter (she was in the car while I was outside). I have never moved so fast in my life to get that baby out of the car. I would have dived into flames, into certain death. There is literally no thought process. It was the most single-minded animalistic lizard brain moment I've ever had in my life.  For the record she was fine as we had two other vehicles to buffer that speeding asshole, but the teenagers in the car who stopped to see if we needed help almost died. Sorry for my ramble.

You’d think she was the laziest dog ever until somebody walks through the front door. No matter who it is, within less than half a second she’ll be running towards them at 30 mph with her tail wagging so hard the entire back half of her body shakes with it. She’s 100 lbs of pure muscle too so people tend to freak out but she knows very well not to jump so she just stops right in front of them and wiggles until she gets pets.  Sweetest dog you’ll ever meet, and would never intentionally hurt a fly, but I’ve gotten some pretty bad cuts and bruises, and even a fractured growth plate in my knee from playing with her when she was young and didn’t realize how strong she was yet."

They will say they didn't notice anything (or even better, start pointing things out) but you say no to all guesses and try again, this time walking more slowly. Again, nothing, or guesses, you get the idea. You can do another or a couple more slower walks, then go to punch line. Finally when it's punch line time, you walk verrrrry slowly, but after two steps you stop and flip out, flailing your arms and jumping around like a crazy person, then recover quickly and finish slowly walking the remaining steps. They you turn to them and say ""did you notice it that time?"" It's a good theatrical joke."

The way I've seen it done most successfully was a sketch where one guy was narrating the supposed 'security camera' footage to the audience and telling them that it was footage of a crime taking place and they should see if they can spot the crime. One guy walks in from the right with his hands in his pockets and three guys from the left, the guy from the right passes through the group of three guys seemingly without issue.  Narrator asks if the audience caught it and then plays it back in ""slow motion"" to see if they can see it then.  The whole time the narrator should be going on about how you have to be a trained investigator and crime profiler to be able to spot it happening in real time.   In slow motion everything looks normal again.  Narrator seems surprised they didn't notice what happened.  Offers to play it back again in super slow motion to see if they can notice it then. In ""super slow motion"" when the individual guy coming from the right passes through the group two of the three guys in the group lift the guy up and turn him upside down while the third guy pulls out a bag and holds it under the victim.  The two guys holding the victim then slow motion shake the guy while a ton of loose coins spill from his pockets into the bag below.  They set him back down and everyone continues on in super slow motion like nothing ever happened. Usually gets a pretty good laugh in my experience."

Kishimoto (the Naruto Manga author) wasn't the first to use it. Loads of other manga/ anime used that style or running before Naruto was even a thing.  Like Saint Seiya and Inuyasha.  Naruto popularised it though.  Pretty sure the way those manga do it came from some TV show in the 70's lol

Tear gas is misery.  You know that burning you get in your nose when you breathe in pepper, and that burning in your eyes when you get lemon juice in them?  It's like that, in the way that a firecracker is like a nuclear bomb. Your body revolts against it.  Every mucus-producing a surface in your nose and throat convulses, and you are instantly crying harder than you ever have, your nose is dumping mucus a thousand times worse than the worst cold you've ever had, your throat is sealing up desperately trying to keep the poison out of you, and every neuron in your mind is screaming to flee.  You are actively being poisoned and your body is trying to repeal it in every way it can, throwing every emergency button it can find. When I was in basic training I watched many grown men frantically run and claw at walls trying to get away from the pain.  Men who would throw the door's open, running outside blind face first into a tree clawing at their eyes. That shit is gaseous pain.  It is a chemical weapon, not a smoke grenade like we see in videos safely behind our screens. And these people are running towards it to spare their fellow protesters.  To stop it from breaking them up. I can't say I'd be as strong as that.  Nothing but respect."

I wasn't quite in the ""about to die clawing at the walls"" level like some of them were, but I sure as hell respected their take on the situation, hahaha.

But China won't fully devote if all the protests have an end that China doesn't think is worth the cost. HK is their single strongest economic center, and the best HK can do is make the bill so damn high that just giving them what they want is the more viable option.   On top of which, non-violent protests garner better popular support and are much more likely not to sputter out before they reach the end they want.

Cynicism is an inevitable thing, but it might do more harm than good: There are a disturbing number of posts here that are attempting to completely normalize the idea that 1) China taking HK early is inevitable, and 2) that there is nothing anyone can or will do about it. Either Reddit has become filled with sociopathic armchair assholes (racing to predict a horrible outcome), or some people really want to push a particular narrative and sow the seeds of defeatism for the benefit of a particular government. Seriously, what is the value in pushing that narrative? It's like going to a playground and yelling to children how their future is scorched Earth due to climate change because it is inevitable and no one cares. Are you right? Maybe. Should you share that position so brazenly and thoughtlessly? Fuck no. The future of a few million people are potentially about to change drastically, for the worse, and here we have a room full of pricks jockeying for the rights to call themselves prognosticators. You erode people's sense of hope, will to fight oppression, and prime them to ignore the suffering of others, all so you can sit their smugly and say ""I told you so."" Meanwhile, you are wrong. It may be very likely, but it is not inevitable. Speaking up against China will be costly, but not impossible or ineffective. The people of HK and China do care and notice who in the world has HKs back, and who in the world is readying to look the other way. There is a sickening element here readying others to look the other way. Kinda reminiscent of bots from Russia, no? Certainly China wouldn't do anything like that."

Here is the video if you're curious, the part I'm referring to starts around 9:07. 5 Removed Easter Eggs Never Meant To Be Found I JUST watched a video about a video-game that had an easter-egg calling him Winnie The Pooh, and the game had to be taken down because a bunch of Chinese gamers flooded the game with negative reviews on Steam in defense of him. Ironically, since Steam was never officially allowed in China, they had to use a VPN to access Steam to post the reviews, thus bypassing their dear leader's regulations."

Whether that's ignorance, brainwashing, or active support for one of a variety of reasons (for instance, hundreds of millions of people were lifted to the middle class from poverty over the past few decades). You see it firsthand with the views of the government/CCP among Chinese students at US/UK universities - there's large, nationalist pro-China groups at lots colleges, as well as a ton of more nuanced views.  Obviously not everyone supports the government, but this isn't a simple case of ""Everything pro-Chinese is orchestrated by the CCP""."

At some point a few years ago it became a meme in China to say that Xi looked like Winnie the Pooh, there were lots of examples of memes like this all around the internet. At first it was just a joke, but eventually this meme got so popular amongst the Chinese that it became mainstream, and it reached the point that basically everyone understood that Winnie the Pooh = Xi Jinping. At this point, since it was illegal to criticise Xi himself, people would instead criticise Winnie the Pooh as a proxy, since technically that's not illegal but everyone would know what you meant. For example if Xi did something you didn't like you might go on Weibo (Chinese twitter) and post something like ""Was watching Winnie the Pooh last  night, wow that bear does a lot of dumb stuff haha! Can't believe he's so stupid!"" Eventually the Government caught on to this, and since they don't tolerate ANY criticism of their regime, they simply made it illegal to mention or post anything about Winnie the Pooh."

We had a couple of giggle bouts when my father died unexpectedly at 40 (many years ago). I think your nerves are so raw and there have been so many tears that when something is funny it is really funny. My Dad was cremated and they sent the cremains in what looked like a plastic brick.  They day they arrived they were sitting on the counter because we hadn't thought of what we were going to do with them.  My brother's friend arrives, sits at the counter and starts talking. He absentmindedly picks up the 'brick' and starts tossing it from hand to hand.  My brother and I are giving each other wide eyes - but we don't know exactly what to say. (and to be honest - many people don't visit right after a family death and we were really touched that this friend stopped by just to chat). Finally he stops talking and says ""what is this""?  My brother says ""well, that's my Dad"". His friend was horrified, but we couldn't stop laughing."

I never thought I’d be the kind of person to have deceased pets on my mantle but life changes you I guess.  It was so fucking hard not to laugh hysterically as he carefully poked and prodded the bag of ashes up the cat urn’s butt. Because that’s where the hole was of course.

Like he thought it was so funny that he caught us with a butt plug that we forgot to put away or something and was laughing so hard he was almost crying. I waited a few min because it was really funny and wouldn't have been able to hear me anyway because he was so loud. Finally I told him my dead dad was in there and he realized how much he fucked up. Then everyone really started laughing and making fun of him while he just sat there trying not to laugh and saying sorry. But being 100% honest the small urn does have many of the characteristics that a butt plug would have so I kinda saw where he was coming from.

It seemed like the moment had finally come, it had been at least 15 seconds since she had last inhaled, when all of a sudden she lets out a HUGE gasp for air which was followed by a steady breathe for a while. The first thing out of anyone's mouth was my cousin saying: ""OH YE BITCH"" My Nan went on soon after that, but she went on surrounded by laughter.

And then the moment passes and it's not again. This is so much of that for me. The participants' laugher is the ""it's him!"". It's what happens right before the it's not again. I laugh in terrible situations. I can't help it. I'm sure I would have laughed in moment right along with the family. But here, behind my desk, being reminded of death itself, and how sometimes your brain just won't let go, it got me. So, good on him. Becuase I guess I needed this."

It's not like they have special papers with lineage like a racehorse. I would add that while street and outside cats do not tend to have long lives, former street cats and some bodega cats have lived a long time. My cat was a street/shop cat and the cat at my bodega passed around age 19-20, so it can happen.  In fact, I've often wondered if it's true of cats as it is with dogs, that they tend to be a lot healthier and live longer if they are mixed breed than full blood of one type.  Again, just personal observation, but it does make me wonder."

I've been in the veterinary industry for 15 years now and I've never seen a dog hit 20. Living to 29 would be extraordinarily rare. On the other hand, I've seen probably hundreds of pets whose owners think they are much older than they actually are. They will say their dog is 15, I look at the chart and see we saw it as a puppy in 2009. This kind of thing happens every single day in every vet clinic I've worked in. I've even seen people have completely false memories of when they got a pet. I'll ask how old a cat is, they say they got her when they graduated high school in 2005. I then look at the records and see the last vet saw the cat in 2007 when she weighed a quarter of her adult weight and still had baby teeth. The human memory is a fuzzy and unreliable thing. Unless they have clear, unambiguous documentation I would take any claims of extreme age in pets with a huge grain of salt."

181065,https://old.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/ckbolc/this_is_tiger_he_just_turned_31_we_are_told_he_is/,64,RobotPigOverlord,"Vets estimate age by looking at their teeth and making a pretty rough guess based on what condition their teeth are in. Cats with a mouth full of adult teeth that are perfectly shiny and healthy, theyll estimate are 1-2. Cats with grade IV dental disease, theyll estimate are anywhere between 10-15+. Heres the thing, a cat can be like 7 years old and have an absolutely terrible dental state and estimated to be 15. If a cat was living really rough outdoors, they can easily look twice as old as they actually are, and there's really know way for a vet to tell their true age during a basic physical examination.  Is your cat actually 31? Its highly  unlikely. But thats not a bad thing! It doesn't matter how old he is, what matters is that he is a good old kitty and that he has humans who love him very much.  🤗🐈"

Seriously, even if he wasn’t murdered (which is also possible although unlikely), he was under 24/7 suicide watch after last week.  In the least corrupt situation the guards just were shit at their job, but far more likely they were paid of either by him or by people wanting him murdered to look the other way. Edit: apparantly he wasn’t on suicide watch (anymore?), this wasn’t in the article at my time of posting. Which just raises more questions imo. Edit2: I’ve received over a hundred notifications of people telling me that he wasn’t on suicide watch after I’ve posted my edit that he wasn’t on suicide watch anymore, and why that wasn’t in my initial post. People, please read to the end of my message before accusing me of not reading properly. Edit3: I suggest for everyone to read the WaPo article written by a fmr US attorney and a professor of law, Harry Litman. ‘For anyone familiar with Bureau of Prisons standard operating procedures, Jeffrey Epstein’s apparent suicide is more than mysterious; it is unfathomable. The 66-year-old accused sex trafficker was found dead in his prison cell at the Metropolitan Correction Center (MCC) Saturday morning, apparently after having hanged himself. The Bureau of Prisons, the federal agency that runs the MCC, has said the FBI will investigate. It had better. Epstein’s death almost certainly means that astounding blunders occurred, perhaps by multiple personnel at the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). If any prisoner in the federal system should have been a candidate for suspicion of suicide, it was the high-profile and disgraced Epstein. All administrative and structural measures should have been in place to ensure it could not happen. And yet it apparently did. First, consider the MCC itself. It is a high-rise, forbidding administrative detention facility in the south of Manhattan. Its population consists almost entirely of prisoners, like Epstein, awaiting trial in federal court in Manhattan. It has been referred to as the “Guantanamo of New York” for its stringent security measures. It is the facility of choice for notorious federal defendants, often in special administrative segregation units, having previously housed John Gotti, Bernard Madoff, Omar Abdel Rahman and, recently, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. In other words, it is the very place to put a high-profile and potentially suicidal defendant such as Epstein. Second, consider the BOP’s suicide prevention protocol. Epstein was found last month unconscious in his MCC cell with marks on his neck. If he was not on suicide watch, it would be astonishing. Yet if he were on suicide watch, his death would be virtually inconceivable. The BOP’s suicide prevention protocol entails, first and foremost, human eyes on the prisoner 24 hours a day. It also requires a strict deprivation of anything — shoelaces, sheets, pillowcases — that could possibly be used to hang oneself. It also requires disabling anything that could be used to tie a noose — vents, sprinkler heads, etc. Finally, we are not talking about inexperienced yokels. BOP personnel, especially at MCC, are the best professionals in the corrections industry, and they receive special training in administrating suicide prevention. Who better to guard against such a horrific development? At this point, questions abound, and BOP has to address them promptly. The first: Was Epstein on suicide watch, and if not, why not? Among the reports cascading out in the few hours since Epstein’s body was found are anonymous statements that Epstein had been on suicide watch but was taken off it. If so, the decision to remove him appears to have been a colossal error that must be thoroughly probed. The second: How exactly did Epstein manage to kill himself, and why exactly was it that he had access to the tools? Third, is there a video of Epstein’s cell at the crucial time? There should be, and it will reveal exactly how and when Epstein killed himself. And none of this begins to address the royal mess it leaves in the efforts to take stock of Epstein’s crimes and their prior slap-on-the-wrist treatment, nor the shambles in which it leaves Epstein’s victims. Almost certainly, we will know a lot more in a few days. But it seems certain that when the facts are known, this will stand as one of the biggest black eyes in the history of the Bureau of Prisons.’"

You can be 100% sure of that. He knew too much information. On a true Suicide Watch, everything gets taken. - Shoelaces - Sheets - Belt - Anything remotely sharp or that can be sharpened - With a full cavity search to find anything hidden inside. You are also put into a thin easily-rippable hospital gown (prevents choking/hanging), inside an empty room with no lamps, no outlets, covered windows, no sharp edges, and lightweight non-rippable mattress. They also check on you every 15 minutes. If they really want to be certain, They put you naked inside a room with a camera, lights on 24 hours a day and a person at the desk watching you at all times. Start running your head into the wall? They will strap you to a bed, or in a chair to restrict your movement, then give you a shot in the ass full of a tranquilizer to put you to sleep No possible way you can commit suicide if whoever is holding you is hell bent on trying to stop you. No fucking way at all."

Ever tried kneeling on your pointed toe for an extended period of time? It's really painful- shifts a lot of your weight to the knee instead of to the leg and that'll dig into the ground. If you're going to be kneeled for awhile splaying the foot out is a lot more comfortable. And if this was a staged shot he would've been kneeling for a long time to get it right I'm sure. source: have proposed a couple times. Both successful. At least the 'proposal' part of the first one was.

Epstein told her to give him a foot massage, they had a nice conversation, worse thing she said was that his feet were disgusting, nearly half the excerpt was her talking about his feet. Then he drew her a couple of pictures because she was a fan. Creepy? Maybe among regulars but massages are kind of common place when you're that rich.    The flight was only short and we arrived in busy L.A. within the hour, saying Good-Bye to Matt, who was a pleasure to meet."

It essentially boils down to more advanced creatures needing more efficient forms of energy consumption. A cow, for example, survives by eating grass all day, since they possess a simpler animal mindset. However, a human being wouldn't be able to use that method effectively, as the amount of time it would take to consume said grass exceeds the singular day it would power us for, so we eat the cow instead, as they've already farmed up all of that energy for us and stored it away in their meat. So assuming that an alien civilization with lightspeed capabilities or greater were to visit Earth, they'd likely need to consume a rather large amount of energy to keep themselves going, and by that logic, well... let's just say that the cow's probably not going to cut it for them."

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

185974,https://old.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/d8bvvm/what_a_considerate_man/,3040,vibratemate,This happened to me. I used to go to Dunkin’ Donuts everyday on break from work and get the same coffee and bag of hash browns. The guy there knew my order and would always have it ready. One day I came in and I was in the mood to try something different so I ordered a muffin instead with my coffee. The guy looks at me and goes “no hash browns?” And I was like thought I would try something different today. When he handed me my order he went “I put the hash browns in the bag too cause I already had them ready for you shhh it’s our little secret”. That bag of free hash browns honestly made my whole day :)))

Always got the same thing, got his senior discount and all. The ladies who worked there all knew him and started calling him Pops. He’d walk in and they’d start getting his coffee ready so by the time he was at the register it was waiting for him. When he got cancer and was too sick from the chemo to go, we’d go in and say “I’m here for an order for Pops.” They’d get his coffee ready and even give the senior discount. They all legit cried the day my dad went in for something for himself and they asked if it was an order for Pops and my dad had to break it to them he had died. I later felt bad that we didn’t go tell them sooner because I guarantee at least a few of the people who worked there would have come to the funeral. Always be a kind person and you will be rewarded with returned kindness and love in droves."

Ask them about their day. People are almost always more glad to talk than you think they might be, and having a happy interaction with a stranger really does make your whole day better, and makes a town or city feel more like a community.  A recent study asked 100 people to say something to strangers each day. Something like 90% had a positive experience and 99% were glad they did it.  Edit: Found the study.  Dr. Sandstrom’s research shows people underestimate how much another person will like them when they talk for the first time. And in a study in which she asked participants to talk to at least one stranger a day for five days, 99% said they found at least one of the conversations pleasantly surprising, 82% said they learned something from one of the strangers, 43% exchanged contact information, and 40% had communicated with one of the strangers again, an indication they might be making friends.

Immediately pissed the curmudgeon in me off that the mother, I presume, clearly overreacts and gets upset at Quinn after this fiasco but was enticing Maverick to continue crawling closer to his sisters, 3x his size, who are jousting for fun when the first thought is he easily could've been smacked in the skull from one of the girls falling into him since that's the entire point of the activity.  Also, what's surprising to me is that people don't even recognize that Quinn (I mean, really with these 2 names?) isn't necessarily pausing for a split second and thinking ""fuck it!""...she pauses and has that quick instinctual moment of knowing she's already going to hit him but is deciding how to contact him in a manner, that she considers, somewhat safer than the completely reckless alternative. That's why she hits the specific area of the body that she does and not near ol Mav's melon head....you can even notice her pull back at the moment of impact attempting to just barely push him over the edge with enough force to slide down 10 inches into the foam. His stupid baby body spinning like a gas station hotdog makes it look way worse than it really was. Quinn is all good in my book. She realizes the weakness that emblazoned this family long ago and is finally doing something about it."
